db homework no2:
1. there is a redundant primary key,
we have an id of a costumer therefore we dont need another integer primary key.
also, there is no need to save the name of the costumer inside this table.
there should be another table with costumer id and his matching name.
There is a multi value attribute which is 'pusrcheses', should be in a different table aswell.
2. insertion anomaly - when inserting a new purchase.
 you can enter the same id with a different name for example.
 update anomaly - you can update 
 3.
CREATE TABLE PURCHASES (customerId INTEGER, purchase_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (costumerId, purchase_id)
CREATE TABLE COSTUMERS (PRIMARY KEY customerId INTEGER, COSTUMER_name TEXT NOT NULL)
CREATE TABLE ITEMS (PRIMARY KEY ID INTEGER, name TEXT NOT NULL);

4. MULTI VALUE ATTRIBUTE 'PURCHESES' , and redundant primary key id
